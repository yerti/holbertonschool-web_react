In this task_1 folder it contains 3 configuration files that are package.json,  tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js which in order to initialize them we must execute the following command.

To execute the commands you should be in a terminal, either Visual Studio Code or the one of your choice. Also, your path should be in the task_0 folder.

```
npm install
```
This will install the tools and libraries required to build and run the project.


To compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript and create an HTML file, use the following command:
```
npm run build
```

This generates a dist folder with an index.html file. Open this HTML file in your web browser and right click and choose the inspect section and go to the console there you will see the result of our teacher interface.
